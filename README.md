The basic controls are available within the program window. 
To change the test particle system, navigate to GridSolver.h and change the value of the pSystem variable
You can also change the gravity applied as well as the number of particles (modify particlesX and particlesY)

Lastly, to change the cell size, use the slider then press the "r" key to reset the simulation.

Be use to have all the 3rd party tools from assignment 3 before using cmake. Follow the set up as described before.
